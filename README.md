1. In order to properly use this, you must first enter git clone the repo into your proper directory

2. Ensure Node.js is already installed, as you'll need npm

3. Run "npm install" on the respective directory, this will install all the necessary modules listed in the package.json

4. To run the application, simply enter "npm run dev" in the terminal, a message should pop up saying "Server is running on http://localhost:5500"

5. Either click [here](http://localhost:5500), or enter the full link provided to see the frontend

6. Everything else is a WIP
